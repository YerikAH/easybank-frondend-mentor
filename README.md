# Frontend Mentor | easybank solution 
This is a solution to the Easybank page. The challenge is from [Front-end Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN)
## Challenge consists of
1. View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
1. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
## What I learned
I learned to use the styled-component library which was something new. On the other hand I used react and it was difficult to remove the scroll when leaving the mobile menu so I used the [react-remove-scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-remove-scroll) dependency.
## Technologies used in the project 
- React
- styled-components
- CSS
